The P&L statement should include the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT values for all the years there is historical data available for that company in the dataset.
    - **Description:** I have used the Fundamentals.csv and Securities.csv files provided by Kaggle. The Fundamentals file provides the fundamental financial data gathered from SEC 10K annual filings from 448 companies listed on the S&P 500 index. The Securities file provided the industry or sector information the companies are categorized under on the S&P 500 index.

Assumptions for revenue growth, gross margin, and operating margin should change for each scenario.
